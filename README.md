Cryptography Project

The Cryptography Project is a software program that allows users to encrypt and
decrypt various types of files using the Fernet encryption algorithm. The program
supports encryption of text files, images, PDFs, and other document files. It
provides a user-friendly interface for selecting files and performing encryption
and decryption operations.


Functions:
1. Encrypt File:
 - This function allows users to select a file and encrypt it using a randomly
 generated encryption key. The encrypted file is saved with a custom file
 extension.
2. Decrypt File:
 - This function allows users to select an encrypted file and enter the encryption
 key to decrypt it. The decrypted file is saved without the encryption extension.
3. Copy Encryption Key:
 - This function allows users to copy the encryption key to the clipboard for
 easy sharing or storage.
